# Flash Installation Guide

Requirements:

- Daijishou
- Kiwi Browser
- Some .swf files to run
- Install the Kiwi Browser from the Play Store, then install [the ruffle extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ruffle/donbcfbmhbcapadipfkeojnmajbakjdc) download some games and exit from Kiwi Browser.

Then open Daijishou, install the Daijishou Homebrew Repository (made by me ;) ) and search for "Flash" in the platforms.

Click on "Path" and add the folder with your swf games,
then click on Sync and finally try to run a game.
Grant Storage permission to Kiwi Browser and profit.

Limitations:

- You can only run files from internal storage and not from an external media device (like an sdcard or an ssd), because Kiwi doesn't have the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. (Android 11 and later only)
- Point and click are recommended, as you aren't going to have an on screen keyboard or controller
- No theme supports the platform so you are going to end with an Arcade Classic wallpaper (still you can change it in platform settings)
- Ruffle can't really run every swf, but still, the great majority does.
- You can play only games you downloaded from kiwi Browser (Android 11 and later only)
