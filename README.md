# Daijishou-android. Get Android platform back.

This is a simple Daijishou platform repository fork for using Android games as a platform.

# How to use it:

- Open Daijishou
- Click on Download 
- Click on Index Uri
- Change 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magneticchen/Daijishou/main/platforms/index.json` 

   to 

   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savethekiddes/Daijishou/main/platforms/index.json` 

# Disclaimer

It's really likely that I will not update this repository with further platforms being added. So it's recommended to switch back to the magneticchen index after finishing installing Android platform. The Android platform is still deprecated so is not supported by magneticchen nor by me. This is just a simple workaround.
